In this project, I am  two embedding techniques: BERT and Doc2vec that capture semantic similarities(degree of resemblance between 2 words or texts in terms of their meaning) through Cosine similarity between job titles. Then BERT and Doc2Vec embeddings are generated for job_title and the predefined keywords. Using Cosine similarity, similarity scores are calculated between job_title embedding and the keyword embeddings. 
By calculating weighted average of the similarity scores using BERT and Doc2vec, the weights are adjusted based on user's preferences. 
Finally, candidates are sorted in descending order based on their weighted similarity scores to get best relevant candidates.
